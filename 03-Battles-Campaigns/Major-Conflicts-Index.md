| 8 | **Battle of Ankara** | July 20, 1402 | Battle | Timurid Empire | Catastrophic Ottoman defeat; Bayezid captured | Bayezid I vs. Timur | ***** | HIGH | NOT STARTED |

### Narrative Context — Founding Period
The early Ottoman state expanded through a combination of ghazi frontier raiding, strategic marriages, and opportunistic conquest. The Balkans fell rapidly after the crossing into Europe (1352-1354). The Serbian defeat at Kosovo (1389) and the Crusader disaster at Nicopolis (1396) established the Ottomans as Europe's dominant military power — until Timur's devastating victory at Ankara (1402) nearly destroyed the young empire. The resulting decade-long civil war (Interregnum, 1402-1413) tested whether the Ottoman state could survive the loss of its sultan.

## Interregnum and Recovery (1402-1453)

| # | Conflict | Date | Type | Opponent(s) | Outcome | Key Figures | Fiction Potential | Priority | Status |
|---|----------|------|------|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| 9 | **Ottoman Interregnum** | 1402-1413 | Civil War | Ottoman princes vs. each other | Mehmed I victorious after eliminating rivals | Mehmed I, Süleyman Çelebi, İsa Çelebi, Musa Çelebi | **** | MEDIUM | NOT STARTED |

| 11 | **Second Battle of Kosovo** | Oct 17-19, 1448 | Battle | Hungarian | Ottoman victory | Murad II vs. John Hunyadi | *** | MEDIUM | NOT STARTED |

### Narrative Context — Recovery
The Interregnum (1402-1413) was the Ottoman Empire's near-death experience. Four princes fought for the throne while Timur's successors, Byzantine remnants, and Balkan Christian states all tried to exploit the chaos. Mehmed I's reunification was followed by Murad II's consolidation, capped by crushing Crusader defeats at Varna (1444) and the Second Battle of Kosovo (1448). These victories cleared the strategic board for the greatest Ottoman military achievement: the conquest of Constantinople.

### Narrative Context — Classical Age
This period represents the Ottoman Empire at its military zenith. The fall of Constantinople (1453) was the defining event — a 21-year-old sultan conquering the city that had resisted 1,100 years of attacks. Selim I's eastern campaigns (Chaldiran, Egypt) doubled the empire's territory in three years. Süleyman I's campaigns brought the Ottoman frontier to the gates of Vienna. The naval campaigns of Barbarossa established Ottoman dominance across the Mediterranean. The period ends with Süleyman's death at Szigetvár (1566) — the last sultan to die on campaign.

## Transformation Era Conflicts (1566-1700)

| 37 | **Battle of Zenta** | Sept 11, 1697 | Battle | Habsburg Austria | Devastating Ottoman defeat | Ottoman forces vs. Prince Eugene of Savoy | *** | LOW | NOT STARTED |

### Narrative Context — Transformation Era
Lepanto (1571) shattered the myth of Ottoman naval invincibility, though the fleet was rebuilt within a year. The Long Turkish War showed the limits of Ottoman offensive capability in Central Europe. Internally, the Celali Revolts devastated Anatolia. Murad IV's Baghdad campaign (1638) was the last great sultanic military triumph. The second siege of Vienna (1683) was the empire's greatest gamble — and its greatest disaster. The Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) marked the first time the Ottomans ceded major territory to Christian powers. Modern scholarship emphasizes that this period involved institutional transformation rather than simple decline.

### Narrative Context — Late Period
The 18th and 19th centuries saw the Ottoman Empire engaged in existential military struggles. The Russo-Turkish Wars (twelve in total, 1568-1918) were the empire's most persistent military challenge. The Greek War of Independence (1821-1829) demonstrated the power of European nationalism backed by Great Power intervention. Mahmud II's destruction of the Janissaries (1826) was simultaneously a military necessity and a cultural revolution. The Balkan Wars (1912-1913) destroyed the empire's European heartland in weeks. World War I, and especially the Gallipoli Campaign (1915), provided the final military chapter — and, in Mustafa Kemal's defense of Gallipoli, the founding myth of the successor Turkish Republic.

**Note on the Armenian Genocide:** This entry documents the systematic destruction of the Armenian population as established historical fact, per the overwhelming scholarly consensus. It is not rated for "fiction potential" as it is a genocide, not a dramatic scenario. It is included in this index because it is an essential component of Ottoman military and political history during WWI.
