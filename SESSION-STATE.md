## Handoff Notes for Next Session

### Recommended Starting Point
Begin with **Phase 1: Master Timeline** (`TL-00-Master-Timeline.md`). The timeline is the backbone of the project — all subsequent prosopography and battle profiles will cross-reference it. Aim for 500+ events spanning 1000-1922 CE.

### Key Decisions Already Made
1. **Modern Turkish spellings** as default (Mehmed not Muhammad for sultans, Süleyman not Suleiman)
2. **Decline thesis rejected** — use "transformation" language per modern scholarship
3. **Academic rigor + fiction utility** — every profile gets a "For Fiction Writing" section
4. **Confidence levels required** for all historical claims: [Established], [Probable], [Debated], [Speculative], [Traditional]
5. **File prefixes:** HF- (figures), BC- (battles), GE- (geography), DY- (dynasty/political), TL- (timeline), RE- (religion/culture)
6. **Cross-reference actively** with Byzantium, Crusades, Islamic Caliphates, European History, Russian History projects

### Sources to Prioritize
- Finkel's *Osman's Dream* for narrative backbone
- Inalcik's *Classical Age* for institutional depth
- Kafadar's *Between Two Worlds* for founding period
- Peirce's *Imperial Harem* for royal women
- Murphey's *Ottoman Warfare* for military detail
- Crowley's *Constantinople* for the 1453 siege

### Watch For
- Early Ottoman chronology is **contested** — Osman's dates, the nature of the early beylik, the role of Ertuğrul are all debated
- The "Sultanate of Women" label is **problematic** — it was coined by hostile Ottoman male historians; use critically
- The Armenian Genocide is **established historical fact** — note the scholarly consensus without equivocation
- Ottoman province names **changed over time** — track eyalet-to-vilayet transitions
